Partial todo list (this is minor stuff I might forget, not big
features)

  - rationalize substitutions to allow ${true} and treat
    ${"foo.bar"} as a path also.
  - create a SimpleConfigObject.empty() instead of doing it
    by hand in a couple places
  - rename AbstractConfigObject.resolve() to avoid resolver
    confusion
